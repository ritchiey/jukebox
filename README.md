# Jukebox - A demo Trailblazer application

This is an otherwise pointless Rails application intended to demonstrate
techniques for improving a Rails Application using the
[Trailblazer Framework](http://trailblazer.to/).

The application provides CRUD for Artists, Songs and Albums which are related
in much the way you'd expect. A totally boring domain so we can focus on the
details of the implementation.

## Trailblazer Features Used

 - Operations
 - Has-Many Association
 - Dry-Validations
 - Uniqueness Validation

# Licence
Jukebox is released under the MIT License.
